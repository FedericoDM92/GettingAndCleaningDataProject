# GettingAndCleaningDataProject

**Dataset**
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones.

**Files**
CodeBook.md the code book of the variables.
UCI HAR Dataset and dataproject.zip the dolders containg the data.
run_analysis.R the script that clean the data.
smallcleandata.txt the file containing the final tidy data frame.

**Execution**
run_analysis.R performs the data preparation following the 5 steps indicated by the project:
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
smallcleandata.txt is the exported final data frame after the cleaning.
