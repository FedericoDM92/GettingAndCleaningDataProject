# GettingAndCleaningDataProject

**Dataset**
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones./n

**Files**
CodeBook.md the code book of the variables./n
UCI HAR Dataset and dataproject.zip the dolders containg the data../n
run_analysis.R the script that clean the data../n
smallcleandata.txt the file containing the final tidy data frame./n

**Execution**
run_analysis.R performs the data preparation following the 5 steps indicated by the project:./n
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set../n
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement../n
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set./n
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names../n
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject../n
smallcleandata.txt is the exported final data frame after the cleaning../n
